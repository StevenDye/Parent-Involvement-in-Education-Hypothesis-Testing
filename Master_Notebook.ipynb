    "Our data is the National Household Education Survey Program of 2016 from the National Center for Education Statistics. This data was collected in the NHES's Parent and Family Involvement in Education (PFI) Survey. The survey collects data on children from grades kindergarten to 12th grade and asks various questions about the child's performance in school and the involvement of the parents. The survey is filled out by the parents. The data is compiled in a csv file with 822 columns and 14075 entries.\n",

    "For high performing students, the mean parental involvement hours per year was 8.195917 with a standard deviation of 9.280269 while for low students, the mean was 5.990725 hours with a standard deviation of 7.236390. Since the data is ratio and consists of two independent samples from a non-normal distribution, a Mann-Whitney U test was used to measure significance. This gives a t score of 7094495.5, resulting in a p-value of 3.18e-38. The Cohen's d value was found to be 0.24466330903542002. With an alpha value of 0.05, the power was calculated to be 1.0."
